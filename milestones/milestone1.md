The ideation process for this unit was smooth and I was able to come up with something I'm excited about and would use myself.

I lost my teammate halfway in this this unit but I was able to adjust and come up with something feasible.

Nothing much, just going to use my time wisely to make sure I can develop all the features I outlined.
