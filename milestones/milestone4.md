## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Was able to finish the backend development, defined the necessary endpoints to fulfill the rest of the features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Had some issues testing enpoints due to postman, couldn't make server requests and thought my server setup was wrong. However, just turned out my session cookies were simply not working, so found an alternative option to testing endpoints. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Since my features depened heavily on the backend functionality of my app I was not able to finish fully a feature, however, on track to finish all of them by next week.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Id say my Job listings feature is at risk, although not hard to code for, seems like I won't have enough time to build it out like I planned. Ill try my best and make sure I prioritize and fulfill the project requirements first.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

No additional support is needed right now.
